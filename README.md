# Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism </h1>

The project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Dataset. The primary objective of this project is to gain valuable insights and a comprehensive understanding of terrorism incidents on a global scale by leveraging this extensive dataset. Through visualizations, statistical analysis, and data exploration techniques, we delve into various aspects such as attack trends, geographical patterns, terrorist groups, casualty statistics, and more. The quality of data is ensured by performing necessary preprocessing steps, including cleaning the data, imputation of missing values, and identifying outliers. By applying these analytical techniques, we aim to shed light on significant characteristics of terrorist incidents, including prominent hotspots, prevalent attack types, targeted categories, most used weapons and changes over time. The project aims to uncover hidden patterns and provide meaningful insights to support informed decision-making and contribute to the broader understanding of global terrorism.
